# Weather Now

## Description
A simple web app designed with Google's material design philosophy in mind that displays the weather in a city that you enter. Weather Now uses AngularJS, Bootstrap, Material Design Bootstrap and gets its information from OpenWeatherMap using their API.

## Current Status
Weather Now is currently in development. In the future version I plan on adding UV index, 5 day forecast and air polution.
